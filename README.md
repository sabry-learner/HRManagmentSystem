# HRManagmentSystem

The HR Management System is a software application that aims to automate the management of employee records, benefits, and payroll. 
It consists of several classes that represent different types of employees, benefits, and departments.
The main class is HRSystem, which handles the operations on the employee list and the total payroll. 
The project demonstrates the use of inheritance, polymorphism, and aggregation in object-oriented programming.
